Designing a general purpose event driven network simulator


## architecture

simulation engine
network model

## features

traffic modeling
network topology config
packet routing and forwarding
congestion control and management

> config.ini to specify simulation parameters

## plugins

- none for now but add for new features

## interface design

- simulation control interface
- reporting and analysis tool (quick prototyping)

## performance considerations

- scalability
- accuracy
